// IPP Repository on Github

// This is my collection of Inspiration pad pro generators. I had to switch
// and use GIT after losing over one hundred man hours that had been invested 
// into building custom name generators for Inspiration Pad Pro. My computer 
// died, and the retarded default location IPP automatically stores generator 
// files, namely the Windows Documents folder, ensured that IPP generator files 
// were not included in the automatic systems backup where I had archived 
// important files on a 4 Tb disk archive. Now, with GIT, my random generator 
// filesare stored first in the cloud, then I get an additional local backup
// on the 4Tb HDD backup disk.
