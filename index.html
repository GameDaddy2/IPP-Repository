<p>This is my collection of Inspiration Pad Pro generators. I had to switch
and use GIT after losing over one hundred man hours that had been invested 
into building custom name generators for Inspiration Pad Pro. My computer 
died, and the retarded default location IPP automatically stores generator 
files, namely the Windows Documents folder, ensured that IPP generator files 
were not included in the automatic systems backup where I had archived 
important files on a 4 Tb disk archive. Now, with GIT, my random generator 
files are stored first in the cloud, and am also doing a local backup
on the 4Tb HDD backup disk.</p>
