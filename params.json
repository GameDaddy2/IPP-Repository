  "body": "### Welcome to the IPP-Repository Pages on Github.\r\n\r\nThis is my collection of Inspiration Pad Pro generators. I had to switch\r\nand use GIT after losing over one hundred man hours that had been invested \r\ninto building custom name generators for Inspiration Pad Pro. My computer \r\ndied, and the retarded default location IPP automatically stores generator \r\nfiles, namely the Windows Documents folder, ensured that IPP generator files \r\nwere not included in the automatic systems backup where I had archived \r\nimportant files on a 4 Tb disk archive. Now, with GIT, my random generator \r\nfiles are stored first in the cloud, and am also doing a local backup\r\non the 4Tb HDD backup disk.\r\n\r\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007\r\nThese generator config files in the IPP Repository are being made available \r\nto you the reader under the GNU GPL3 public license, the terms of which are\r\noutlined below.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2016, Dirk T.
